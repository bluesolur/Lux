	<hr>
<p>Lux is a technology online store. You can get stuff like computers, servers, consoles, monitors, phones, and all kinds of other stuff. My name is Julia Morales, and I want to program websites and become a website developer. I am also the creator and owner of this website. This website was opened due to a project I have to do in my e-Commerce I Honors class. Over the course of six weeks, we had to come up with an idea for our own e-Commerce store and make a real website people could possibly view. I opted to doing a technology store, as technology is always changing and becoming more advanced. We basically run on technology. So my goal is to give these pieces of technology at a cheaper price than what you would usually have to pay for in competing companies.</p>
